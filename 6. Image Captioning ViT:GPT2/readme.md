## Image Captioning Project Summary (In progress Apr 4 2023)

The objective of the project is to design and develop an advanced artificial intelligence image captioning system that is capable of generating captions for images or video frames without human involvement. 

### ViT/BERT, ViT/GPT ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21034990/233729906-8617d2ea-82c8-446e-ba49-4b88cce72cef.png)
Encoder and Decoder Architecture
In our work, we have adopted an encoder and decoder approach, utilizing Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder to generate image embeddings, and compared the outcomes by 2 different decoders - BERT and GPT2.

They key part is the cross-attention head which takes the key and value from encoder, and query from decoder embeddings to achieve the attention between image patches of which represents location in an image.  At each training step, the model predicts sequence of words by comparing the ground truth caption.

### Results
Upon observing the results, we can see that the prompts generated by both BERT and GPT-2 align with the semantic meaning of the images. While BERT generates sequences that are within the defined sequence length, GPT-2 tends to produce longer texts due to its emphasis on prompt generation during training.
